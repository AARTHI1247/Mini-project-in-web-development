# Mini project in web development
The Food Order App is a simple and fun web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to place food orders by entering their details and instantly displays them on the screen.

This project helped me understand how to structure web pages with HTML, style them with CSS, and make them interactive with JavaScript.
Itâ€™s part of my learning journey in web development to build real-world projects and strengthen my frontend skills.
